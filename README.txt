# Introduction

The original project are the homework structure of GAMES101 lectures. Because
the official homework structure was deployed on linux virtual machine which is
not convenient for virtual-machine-hater. The original author has set this
project ready for win10 + vs2019 environment, which is out of date. So I
modified this project and make it run correctly in win10 + vs2022 environment.
